# Volume-Hand-Control

User can control his system's volume by making some hand gestures. I have built using OpenCV library.

This project is a use case of Hand Tracking technology.

As soon as the user shows up his hand in the camera the application detects it & draws a bounding box around the hand.

Then according to the distance between user's thumb finger and Pinky it displays the volume in the volume bar on the screen .

To set this volume as the system's volume user has to bend his Index finger simultaneously.


## Quickstart
